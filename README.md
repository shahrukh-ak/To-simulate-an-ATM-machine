# To-simulate-an-ATM-machine
## The customer will enter the amount to be withdrawn as input and it will dispense the cash with a minimum number of bills if it can dispense the input amount with the available bills.
Assume in an ATM machine dispenses bills for $100, $50, $20, $10, and $5 only. Write a python program atm.py to simulate an ATM machine in which the customer will enter the amount to be withdrawn as input and it will dispense the cash with a minimum number of bills if it can dispense the input amount with the available bills. Following are a few test cases for your program:<br>
Enter the amount for withdrawal: 145 <br>
Please collect your bills as follows: $100: 1 $20: 2 $5: 1 <br>
Enter the amount for withdrawal: 73 <br> 
The amount cannot be withdrawn.
